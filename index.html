    <h1>Global Energy Transition: Fossil Fuels to Renewables</h1>
    <p>
      This project will examine how the global energy system is shifting from fossil fuels
      toward renewables using the <strong>Our World in Data Global Energy</strong>
      dataset. Our focus will cover four research questions:
    </p>
    <ol class="tight">
      <li>How has the <strong>United States'</strong> energy use evolved over time?</li>
      <li>Which countries are <strong>electricity import-dependent</strong>, and how have they changed since 2000?</li>
      <li>How do major renewable/alternative electricity generation technologies (solar, wind, nuclear, hydro, biofuels) differ in their
          <strong>S-curve adoption</strong>?</li>
      <li>How does a country’s <strong>GDP</strong> relate to its use of renewable energy?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Each tab addresses these questions with an interactive visualization.

        <h3>Dataset for Global Map</h3>
        <p>
          For the global renewable map, we constructed <code>energy_mix_1980_2023.csv</code>, which
          stores each country’s <strong>primary energy mix</strong> by year:
        </p>
        <ul class="tight">
          <li><strong>Years</strong>: 1980–2023, for countries with provided data</li>
          <li><strong>Columns</strong>:
            <code>iso_code</code>, <code>country</code>, <code>year</code>,
            <code>renewables_share_energy</code>, <code>fossil_share_energy</code>,
            <code>coal_share_energy</code>, <code>oil_share_energy</code>,
            <code>gas_share_energy</code>
          </li>
            <li><strong>Logic</strong>:
            If <code>fossil_share_energy</code> was missing, but
            <code>renewables_share_energy</code> was available, we set
            <code>fossil_share_energy = 100 − renewables_share_energy</code>
            and dropped rows with missing key fields
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Patterns from the Data</h3>
    <ul class="tight">
      <li>
        <strong>Steady rising Global demand</strong>. Total primary energy use grows linearly over the last four decades, with small dips connected to global recessions
        and COVID-19. All transitions from fossil fuels will need to happen while demand is still increasing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fossil Fuels dominate, renewables 2x global share.</strong>
        The global renewable share rises from roughly <strong>10% in 1980</strong> to
        about <strong>20% in 2023</strong>, meaning that even after four decades,
        around four-fifths of primary energy remains fossil-based. At this rate, the world will largely fall short of its
          projected climate goals outlined by the UN and Paris Climate Agreement.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Patterns emerge across regions</strong>. Nordic and a few Latin American
        countries now get 50% or more of their energy from renewables, while historically
        fossil fuel-exporting economies have largely been stagnant.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Electricity is concentrated</strong>. A majority of countries trade electricity, usually fossil fuels,
        but only ~61% of countries are within ±5% of self-sufficiency in imports.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>US Energy Mix Over Time</h2>

    <p>
      This line chart compares <strong>renewable</strong> and
      <strong>fossil fuel</strong> energy consumption in the United States from
      the 1960s to 2023, in terawatt-hours (TWh)
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      Interaction: hover over the lines to see the exact fuel consumption for the given year.
      The red line is fossil fuels; green line is renewables.
    </p>

    <p>
      The plot shows that US fossil fuel consumption has stayed high - above
      <strong>14,000&nbsp;TWh</strong> for most of the period with slight declines from the late-2000s.
        Renewables start from a relatively small share, but begin accelerating after 2005.
      By 2023, renewables exceed <strong>3,000&nbsp;TWh</strong>, roughly 3-4x
      its 1980 level, with fossil fuels still representing the majority of energy use. The US represents a common pattern among fossil-field exporting nations - rapid growth in
      renewables layered on top of an existing fossil system, with slow renewable energy growth relative to fossil fuels.

    <h2>Electricity Independence - Net Imports as % of Demand</h2>

    <p>
      The choropleth map shows each country’s
      <strong>net electricity imports as a % of domestic demand</strong>
      from 2000 to 2023. Purple color represents net exporters, white self-sufficiency, orange net importers.
    </p>

      Interaction: use the slider or play/pause button to move across years. Hover to see net imports, total electricity
      generation, and renewable share for the year.
    </p>

    <p>
      A pattern within the global map is <strong>larger economies are more self-sufficient</strong> for electricity.
      The United States only imports <strong>0.4% of its electricity demand</strong>
      even though it is the <strong>4th-largest importer by volume</strong>, while China exports
      <strong>0.1% of its electricity production</strong>. These country's size allows them to balance their grids and reduce exposure to international energy shocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast, <strong>smaller countries are dependent on imports</strong> from others. Luxembourg
      imports <strong>79%</strong> of its demand, Djibouti <strong>72%</strong>, and Afghanistan
      <strong>87%</strong>. These countries may have high renewable shares, but their energy
      relies on neighbouring nation's grids. Of <strong>173 countries</strong> in the data, <strong>105 (61%)</strong> fall within
      ±5% of self-sufficiency, and the median country has <strong>0</strong> net imports, meaning half of all countries
      are net exporters of energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The map also highlights some specific changes with smaller countries. Paraguay remains a large exporter, but its net exports
      fell from <strong>~773%</strong> of domestic demand to a
       <strong>~121%</strong> through the decades. Bhutan moves in the opposite direction, shifting from
      exporting <strong>337%</strong> of its production to importing <strong>7%</strong>.
      Not represented in the chart is how infrastructure and demand fluctuations change country’s energy position, particularly if they are smaller.

    <h2>Renewable Adoption S-Curves</h2>

    <p>
      The multi-chart figure compares global electricity generation from
      <strong>solar</strong>, <strong>wind</strong>, <strong>nuclear</strong>,
      <strong>hydro</strong>, and <strong>biofuels</strong>. Each subplot overlays the
      historical time series with a fitted S-curve projected until 2050, to show
      where each technology appears along the adoption path.
    </p>

    <div class="viz-frame">
      <iframe src="viz_scurve_tech.html"
              title="S-curve panel for energy technologies"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p class="note">
      Interaction: hover over the solid and dashed lines to see historical generation values and the fitted S-curve for each energy type. Click on the legend to add/remove an energy type from
        the chart.
    </p>

    <p>
      The biggest pattern from the S-curves is <strong>solar’s growth</strong> over the last two decades. Solar generation
      was at <strong>0</strong> in 2000 but reached <strong>2,131&nbsp;TWh by 2023</strong>. Wind, which started in the late
      1970s, now generates <strong>2,497&nbsp;TWh</strong>, only slightly more than solar. Solar
      achieved the same growth as wind in half the time, making
      it the fastest growth renewable-energy represented by the graphs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other technologies follow slower or plateauing trajectories on the S-curve. Hydroelectric grew
      gradually from <strong>923&nbsp;TWh</strong> in 1965 to <strong>4,419&nbsp;TWh</strong> in 2023. Nuclear grew
      from the 1970s through the 1990s at
      <strong>2,700&nbsp;TWh</strong>, but has since stabilized. These disparities, particularly nuclear, represent how each energy type's S-curves are affected by economics, policy,
      and public opinion, which were not represented in the dataset. Biofuels grew modestly in comparison with all other energy types, connecting to their geographic-influenced rate of usage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The graphs suggest <strong>wind and solar</strong> are in the <strong>
      growth phase</strong> of their respective S-curves, with no visible flattening with their technological maturity. Nuclear in particular is unclear as its growth was based on policy,
      infrastructure, and social acceptance, of the respective era, with global adoption fluctuating after the end of the cold war.

    <h2>GDP vs Renewable Energy Share</h2>

    <p>
      The bubble chart plots each country’s <strong>GDP per capita</strong>
      against their <strong>renewable share of primary energy</strong> for 2022. Bubble size is

    <p class="note">
      Interaction: hover over a bubble to see the country name, GDP per capita, renewable share,
      and energy consumption. Use the legend to toggle regions on/off.
    </p>

    <p>
      The chart shows <strong>no noticeable relationship</strong> between wealth and renewables as a share of total energy.
      Countries with similar GDP per capita have renewable shares ranging
      from 0% to 70%, representing a break from the notion that GDP, GDP per capita, or GDP growth determine a country's use of renewable energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Region-to-region patterns are present. In <strong>Northern Europe</strong>, high-income
      countries such as Norway, Iceland, and Sweden have GDP per capita above
      <strong>$50–60k</strong> with renewable shares in the <strong>50–70%</strong> range, while
      other European nations with GDP per capita between <strong>$30–60k</strong> cluster by
      <strong>10–40%</strong> renewable share, despite being in the same region. <strong>South America</strong> shows several lower-middle-income
      outliers, with GDP per capita at a lower <strong>$15k</strong>, but renewable shares near
      <strong>50%</strong>. This represents a break from the assumed high GDP to high renewables norm.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <strong>Asia</strong>, larger energy consumers stand out as a result of their large populations.
      China and India have lower renewable use at <strong>0–20%</strong> each, at
      larger total consumptions, representing a heavier reliance on fossil fuels. This suggests there could be a relationship between population and scope of fossil fuel usage. The
      <strong>Middle East</strong> presents as a cluster of high GDP per capita countries with
      a lower renewable energy share. This region in particular uses oil and gas, which can be tied to their global presence in fossil fuel exports through OPEC.
      <strong>North America</strong>, especially the US and Canada have higher energy
      use but more modest renewable energy shares, with the US at <strong>11%</strong>. <strong>Africa</strong>
      has lower overall energy usage, with renewable energy usage different across nation's borders. <strong>Oceania</strong> provides
      another contrast, with Australia combining high GDP and low renewable share, and
      smaller, Pacific nations having lower GDP and higher renewable shares comparatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the data, we can identify that there is <strong> no direct correlation</strong> between a country's GPD & GDP per capita and renewables as a share of total energy usage.
      Instead, smaller relationships could be found on a region to region basis, implying features not represented in the dataset,
        such as <strong> culture, policy, and geographic differences </strong> may be a stronger indicator of renewable energy implementation.

      This map uses <code>energy_mix_1980_2023.csv</code> to show each country’s

    <p>
      The map summarizes over 40 years of the global energy transition. In the early 1980s, most of the
      world is dark purple, with <strong>80% of primary energy coming from fossil
      fuels</strong>, and having only <strong>0–20%</strong> renewables.
      Over time, the colors in <strong>Western and Northern Europe</strong> and parts of
      <strong>Latin America</strong> slowly brighten. By the mid-2000s, Nordic countries such
      as Sweden and Norway, along with hydropowered nations in South America, show renewable
      shares above <strong>50%</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The transition is much slower in other areas. Large parts of <strong>Asia, the Middle East,
      and North America</strong> remain dark into the 2010s, reflecting a continuing
      fossil-fuel dominance and reliance. Some African countries such as Kenya and Ethiopia brighten, while
      others remain largely unchanged. The United States improves modestly but is still
      darker than most of Europe in 2023.
    </p>
    <p>
      Globally, the renewable share rises from <strong>10% in 1980</strong> to
      <strong>20% in 2023</strong>, meaning that the world is still far from a renewable-dominated energy
      system. Nordic countries show some of the largest improvements, with changes from
      <strong>10–20%</strong> renewables in 1980 to over <strong>50%</strong> today, while
      fossil fuel-exporting economies in the Middle East show the least change. Most
      progress occurs from <strong>2000</strong> to <strong>2020</strong>, as the map brightens across
      Europe, parts of China, Latin America, and a few Asian and African countries.

    <h2>Conclusions &amp; Future Work</h2>

    <h3>Key Findings</h3>
    <ul class="tight">
      <li><strong>Renewables are growing, but still a small share of energy generation.</strong> Solar and wind have reached
          the 2,000–2,500&nbsp;TWh production range in just a few decades, but fossil fuels still supply roughly
          80% of global primary energy.</li>
      <li><strong>Electricity independence is the norm, but not for smaller countries.</strong>
          61% of countries are within ±5% of self-sufficiency, but a subset of small economies
          import 70–80% of their energy needs, making them energy-dependent and unable to respond to possible global events and supply shocks.</li>
      <li><strong>Energy-Technology lifecycles differ.</strong> Hydroelectric and nuclear energies show matured, plateauing
          S-curves, while wind and solar are still in the rapidly growing.</li>
      <li><strong>Wealth does not determine renewables usage.</strong> High-GDP countries are widely represented across all
          renewable shares (0–70%), and no strong relationship can be found between a nation's wealth and their use of renewable energy.</li>
      <li><strong>The global transition is geographically spread out.</strong> Northern Europe and areas of
          Latin America stand out as leaders in renewable energy use, while North American, Asian, African, and Middle Eastern nations lag behind.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Look-back &amp; Next Steps</h3>
    <ul class="tight">
      <li>Our analysis uses <strong>country-level data</strong> to draw relationships, but sectoral, regional, cultural, and sub-national
          breakdowns would better reveal where decarbonization is actually occurring, allowing us to identify the features
          that cause renewable energy growth to be stronger in some areas.</li>
      <li>The S-curve fits are simple, and noisy, particularly with matured technologies. Integrating <strong>uncertainty bands</strong>
          may help give a stronger prediction of future growth, as well as including relevant policy/event markers for each.</li>
      <li>We treat “renewables” as a single category in some areas. Identifying firm versus
          variable renewables (i.e. Solar vs Nuclear), and creating more in-depth breakdowns for each country would help
          us find the specific growth by renewable type.</li>
      <li>Future work could combine the visualizations with more complex <strong>statistical models</strong>
          and alternative data for unseen drivers such as policy, fuel prices, and total investment flows to move from simple
          correlation toward a more complete explanation of the green energy transition globally.</li>
